# The LiV Project

Inheritance is currently a complex, bureaucratic and paper-based process. LiV sees an opportunity to improve the way in which these interactions and services take place. LiV is a web platform built on blockchain and other technologies that addresses authentication & confidentiality issues and protecting users. LiV aims to simplify processes, reduce risks, time and costs for the ecosystem.


## The Technology

LiV will be using decentralised technologies with an encryption component to ensure data privacy and transparency. LiV aims to create a simple and interactive Graphical User Interface for communicating with the blockchain system. We are evaluating the use of a public non-permissioned blockchain, with smart contracts with restricted users that can interact with, as a permissioned contract. We plan on leveraging collaboration with other LEDGER participants to leverage synergies and stronger products built on Open Source.
